We celebrate by writing our fears on a plate and smashing the plate in a bonfire. We started sharing the occasion with friends and family and it grew to become a really incredible celebration. We used it for a fundraiser for mesothelioma, the cancer I lost my lung to.. Up until the pandemic... 2020 was our last party.. My husband, son and I still smashed plates every year though..

My daughter, now 27, was diagnosed with stage 4 mbc in November of 2021. 4 years prior she started bringing up that she had a lump in her breast to her primary care physician, who dismissed her by telling her she was too young for it to be anything serious. The next two visits where she came in to ask questions about the same lump were outright dismissed to the point where she didn't bring it up to anybody else because she felt she was making too big of a deal out of nothing. The next 4 years were filled with multiple incidences of symptoms that should have raised a red flag but every time she was written off because she was young. (And let's face it, female, which seems to be a pre-existing condition to being ignored by doctors) It's valid to be angry and frustrated, and I wish there was an actual solution to get people listened to by their medical providers.My mother died when I was about the same age as your son. The one thing I really wish I had was recordings of her. At that age, it's highly unlikely for him to retain direct memories of you, so his entire knowledge of who his mom was, is going to come through the lens of someone else's memory of you. At least for me, that has always left me feeling very disconnected from her, because I don't know who she was as a person. Record little videos of you telling him about yourself, about your connection to him, and your hopes for his future.

They will test his biopsy for mutation markers and PD-L1 which will guide the oncology team in forming a treatment plan, whether targeted therapy if he has certain markers to immunotherapy with adequate PD-L1. There could be chemo or radiation in the mix. Those alternative options are not something I’d focus on. Stem cell therapy is only in clinical trials. You should have access to excellent oncologists in the Seattle area. Listen to them as they form a treatment plan. I wish you all the best. Keep us updated! (I’m 9 years out from a Stage IV adenocarcinoma diagnosis with 6 recurrences, just FYI.)Great answer and may I just add that staying hydrated is of utmost importance? I drink tons of water in the first few days to flush out toxins. I’m lucky I love water and drink it exclusively, and always have “my emotional support water bottle” right by my side always! 🤣What country are you in? You should have regular appointments with your oncologist. When does chemo begin?I lived clean. Never smoked, ate right, worked out regularly. When I got diagnosed with stage IV adeno my oncologist said it’s becoming more common in female non-smokers and they don’t know why. I quit asking because it doesn’t serve me to ask.

We are here for youThis good news makes us all happy! 🤍🤍🤍You get in a “chemo rhythm.” First one it’s hard to know what to expect. And everyone’s side effects will be different, so keeping a chemo journal will allow her to know that, maybe, by day 5 she can walk more, or by day 10 she gets her appetite back (whatever her side effects are). That way she can kind of know what to expect each round. I was always able to work the day after (probably because all those steroids), but by Saturday evening the “darkness” descended. But always know there is light after the darkness. Always! Hope she tolerates everything with as few side effects as possible! 🤍🤍You are a warrior!

There is another group called breastcancer that may be helpful to you as it has been very helpful to me. There are one people around your age on there as well.I have breast cancer right now for the first time and recurrence is my biggest fear. When I first got diagnosed they told me it was early, was about 0.9 cm and didn’t show any lymph node involvement from biopsy/mri. Found out I had a genetic mutation with no history of cancer on either side of my family. Okay dmx. Surgery path showed a macromet of 7 mm. Okay radiation. My ki67 was high early on so it was aggressive. Oncoscore was 24 so now I’m doing chemo. I am receiving 4 dose dense AC treatments and 12 weekly taxol. I received my second dose of chemo today. The first round was rough not going to lie. Nausea was awful but before my second dose and even when I was at home I was communicating back and forth with the oncology nurse. I was able to mychart my questions or even call if I wanted and she would message back quickly or call back for further information. I got good premeds: steroids and two nausea meds: aloxi and emend. I had others on hand at home compazine and zofran for daytime bd olanzapaine at night. I was switched to phenergan to try and I also got some Reglan when I went to the ER for some shortness of breath ( it turned out to be nothing and may have been anxiety related). Some people say nausea is similar to heart burn so I also do Pepcid daily now or you can do protonix. I did get headaches from all the nausea meds I took. I did however not throw up once. I am now trying a sancuso patch this round to see if it helps. There are many options to manage your side effects. The best thing you can do is find an amazing medical oncologist and I promise you they will do everything they can to manage every single symptom you have. It is scary. My doctor told me I might have some anticipatory nausea this round so she gave me Ativan at the infusion. They will literally do everything to make you as comfortable as possible. You just have to tell them your symptoms and stay on top of them. Best of luck.I’m so so sorry for you and your family. I can’t imagine everything your poor little boy has had to endure. The fact that you’re even asking if everything is going to be okay still just shows how positive of a person you are. I think you’re the only one that can really answer that question for yourself.

I told my doctor and he dismissed it as a pulled muscle, which I kind of agreed with. In May I insisted on an MRI. 25 rounds of radiation, resection of a 4 x 4 cm spindle cell sarcoma, Mets to my lungs, and six rounds of Doxorubicin and Ifosfamide all in hospital left me feeling healthy and cured by April of 2024. Cut to August 7th and a chest CT came back with new and worsening lung Mets. Still stage 4 and about to start maintenance chemo for life.What did they find?I did six rounds of the “red devil” doxorubicin and ifosfamide. My team well handled my nausea so it wasn’t a concern for me at all. Fatigue and low blood counts wiped me out, but I would always bounce back. Eat well and whatever you can tolerate. My taste’s temporarily changed where things I loved tasted awful, but novel things and food from my childhood were okay and my taste for my favorites returned at the end of each cycle. All my infusions were five days of hospitalization for each of my six rounds. I made sure I exercised and did laps around the halls every day. It’s very important to get up and walk around even when you don’t want to. It really helps. It’s not as bad as you think. Lots of people get through it and believe me, you’re as tough as they are.From what I’ve learned, there’s a difference between a “survivor” and what some call themselves, a “thriver”. Survivors seem to go from a stage 4 diagnosis to either remission or NED and enjoy that status (or worry about recurrence) for years and years. Maybe it goes away for good and they can never really believe their good fortune. The self-described “thrivers” are those who go through maintenance chemo or “chemo for life” and cycle on and off treatment. This is my situation it would seem. My prognosis is four years, give or take, but I hope to last longer to watch my grandchildren grow up a bit. A cure is not currently an option, but shrinkage of lung Mets or stability of the same, is the hope.I am stage 4 metastatic soft tissue sarcoma with lung nodules. After finding my lung nodules and determining they were metastatic disease, I had six rounds of doxorubicin and ifosfamide and they basically disappeared. Five months later, they came back with a vengeance. The good news is the ones I have are all at or close to 1 CM, and these are considered small. Check if they sized any of your nodules. Anything under a centimeter is still very small. Also, if you haven’t talked to your care team yet, take a deep breath and relax. My new mantra is “Don’t freak out till you find out”. I know this is worrisome, but you’ll have plenty of time to worry after they do a biopsy. My history tells me if the nodules are small, they may ask you to wait 3 months to do another CT scan, to see if they’ve grown. Most people find the nodules are behaving and you can then decide if you want radiation or surgery. You have plenty of time, my friend. Breast cancer is the most well-researched and supported cancer there is. There are so many more treatments and chemos available to you that have been tested and effective. I’m sending you calming hugs and understanding.',\n",

My surgeon told me to expect just over half a year to possibly as much as three to five years. I was broken after hearing that. I couldn\\'t function and still have difficulty when I think about it. My oncologist told me he wouldn\\'t guess about timelines. He has given me a bit of hope.. There are survivors (depending on the study..) 55%..or 37%..the 15%..or the 2%.. If I go by the studies and papers.. I\\'m in the 2%. It\\'s easy to slip into worst outcome scenarios. But i am doing my best to see all the positives.. I watch my blood work like a hawk and calculate some equations that are shown to indicate prognosis. If something is slipping, I do my best to try and right it. The rabbit holes are out there.. Lol..

At no point was I told, nor did I ever really think, that death was a possibility. It was just half a year of chemo then a lot of recovery. The chances of it coming back are very slim. I still feel weird about the word 'survivor', as well as the thought of having 'beaten cancer'. All I did was turn up to hospital every 2 weeks so that doctors could put a bunch of chemicals into my body. What I've learned over the last few years, however, is that there's different ways of 'surviving'. Sure, death wasn't ever on the horizon for me, but I what DID survive was the mental, physical and emotional stresses that the whole experience puts you through. It completely shakes up your world and how you view life, and all of that has the potential to crush you. It absolutely messed with my mental health as well, and god knows I'm still working through it, but I'm here! I haven't let the cancer beat me completely, because I'm still here, and I'm somewhat okay! So, when the idea of being a 'survivor' comes up, that's how I figure it out in my mind.\",\n",

He would then leave to run errands and take care of our dogs And I would text him when I was almost finished and he would come and pick me up.

              " \"Hello, I was diagnosed with stage IV anaplastic large cell lymphoma at the end of 2019. I was given the best prognosis of 50/50 to make it 2 years with treatment. I went through treatment, I had a stem cell transplant, and now I am still here four plus years after my transplant and almost five years since my diagnosis at the end of this year. I have a very long post from 2019 with all of the details of what happened and how and when if you want to read through that, it's very long though so I'll just kind of hit some of the highlights here. For ten months I had an unexplained itch all over my body and I was having excruciating back pains. My doctor continuously told me that I was being dramatic, or imagining things, or that my house was dirty, or that my dogs were dirty, or just anything for him to not have to do any actual work for me. I woke up one morning completely paralyzed from the waist down so I checked myself into the emergency room and luckily they found all of the tumors on my spine and in my hip. I had four broken vertebrae and my left hip was broken all from tumors growing in those bones. I was told at this time that if I hadn't checked myself into the ER or if we hadn't actually caught the cancer I probably would have been dead in two weeks or so from the tumors completely strangling my nervous system and shutting down my body. I had ten rounds of targeted radiation on all five of my tumors and luckily they shrank to almost nothing. At that point I got a little bit of feeling back from the waist down but it's pins and needles neuropathy, even today this is permanent, so it feels like when you sit on the toilet for too long and your legs go numb. I will say it's not as bad in my waist area as it is in my feet, I feel slight numbness around my hips but then the numbness and the pins and needles exponentially increases as it goes down my body so that my feet are not completely numb but at that point to where they are super sensitive from the pins and needles. Even when my dog accidentally steps on my foot it almost sends me through the roof cuz it hurts so bad. I was in a wheelchair from all of this but because I need to walk to take care of myself because my caregiver is not actually useful or reliable, I taught myself how to walk again. I currently walk with a cane but I did walk with a rollator there for a little while in the middle and it helped a lot with my balance. After radiation I had six rounds of R-CHOP chemotherapy. it went pretty well and at the halfway mark we did a scan and everything seemed to be working so we continued with the other cycles. I was told that at that scan if the treatments were not working we would not have continued on that route and I guess something else would have been done. Now, I don't know, it's possible that they would have just told me that there was nothing they could do but I didn't ask what the alternative would have been because I didn't want to really think about that at that point. I finished my chemotherapy in March of 2020. I was told from almost the beginning that they would want to give me a stem cell transplant if my chemotherapy worked and I was able to get into remission. This wasn't mentioned until quite a ways into my treatment because I think they were waiting to see if it was even a possibility for me to get into remission. From what I understand that was one of the requirements of the stem cell transplant was being NED. So I was supposed to get my stem cell transplant in June I think or may of 2020 but it was during the height of covid and I was really afraid so I did push it back a little bit, it also helps that I was having a very hard time recovering from chemotherapy so they also thought that it might have benefited me to have a little bit of extra time in between. We started all of the prep for the transplant in June and I checked myself into the hospital for the actual procedure July 10th of 2020, one day before my 34th birthday. I had an auto transplant so I feel like I was lucky in that I didn't have to deal with a lot of the other issues that come with transplants like gvhd. I was in the hospital I think 24 or 25 days and then once my immune system rebounded enough for them to release me I was sent home. Typically I would have stayed around the hospital, I had my transplant about 2 hours from my home, but because this was covid and they didn't want me staying in a hotel they sent me all the way home and just discharged me to my regular oncologist. I'm pretty sure that normally at this point you get a lot of support but because of covid I had absolutely no support, and I was just told to follow up with my regular oncologist which I've done but I'm not sure what I missed out on here and what might actually occur for somebody getting a transplant outside of a pandemic. I think for the first year I had scans every 3 months and then we went to every 6 months and after year 3 I haven't had a scan and I expect to have one at my 5th year mark next summer. I've been told that even though my lymphoma is technically uncurable that if I am able to stay in remission for 5 years I will be considered medically cured. And holy hell I said I was going to hit the highlights, and this is still ridiculously long I'm so sorry. It's just you know there's a lot involved. If you have any specific questions I can definitely answer or if you want me to expand on anything I can do that too, I just don't want to make this a 1,000 page novel lol\",\n",

What’s more, chemo made my previously undiagnosed ADHD worse to the point I need to be on meds to manage it. I am also menopausal now and will never have human kids biologically. All of that being what it is, when I get sick, I get SICK. My immune system definitely has taken a hit and I get bronchitis at least once a year now.

Not super lofty goals, but I was content with the company I worked for and was wanting to move up. Then I get diagnosed, fight cancer, then come back to work. During my treatments, I had to use a walker to walk around. At that point, my mobility was getting better and better and I was using a cane. Eventually I was able to walk unassisted… until about July. The prevailing theory right now is the chemo and/or rads weakened my legs. I had to go through intense physio to bring the strength back and even then, my legs haven’t been the same since. I faced a lot of ableism at work. The final straw was in December 2020. I had called in sick due to my legs and the idiot HR rep we had demanded a COVID test, despite me explaining that I don’t have respiratory symptoms and my symptoms are exactly as indicated in the multitude of doctor’s notes I brought in. The HR rep said word-for-word “you’re cured so you’re fine now”. I should have sued, but I made the decision to go back to school and get a better job. I’d go back to school January 2022, quit that job February 2022, and I’d graduate April 2023. What did I go back to school for? Medical office admin.

Fortunately, I\\'ve been cancer free since then and have gone on to have a great life after cancer. After I learned I was in remission, I felt sad and lost for a long time. I thought I \"should\" be happy to be alive and cancer-free, but like you said, nothing was normal, and day-to-day living felt just weird. Plus I had a lot of angst about what I was doing with my life and struggling to envision the future. All those feelings caught me by surprise because here I was cancer free, just like I wanted to be, and why couldn\\'t I enjoy it? For me, though, there were valuable things that came out all the soul-searching I did during that really tough time. Before my diagnosis, I was positive I wanted to pursue a particular career that I was super excited about, and I\\'d just started on a big new chapter. During my treatment I decided to leave that field, though I had no idea what to do instead. After a few aimless years of not really wanting to do anything, I eventually settled on my current career, which I love and which is absolutely a better fit for me. Therapy helped me. Also giving myself lots of emotional space to feel my feelings without judging them. But I think for me what helped the most was just the passage of time, accumulating more and more life experiences, and getting to live a life that I love. Somewhere along the line, cancer went from being this behemoth that defined everything to being a part of my past that was awful but shaped who I became afterward. (Not that it\\'s 100% in the past--there are still medical and emotional effects--but it feels more like a thing of the past than a thing of the present.)

I ended up in the mindset of “so what’s the point now” and knowing that you had the possibility of it resulting in a more grave outcome if not caught.

I won’t say that I don’t struggle mentally with where I am now, but that voice of “what if the cancer is back” is a lot more like a whisper, when it does decide to show up (usually around times when I have my biyearly exams or if something health related seems out of the norm).

No wonder I couldn’t breathe. MRI showed multiple brain tumors and my other scan showed bone cancer in the spine and hip. That was a little over a year ago that I was diagnosed and given a very short prognosis. Happy to report they were wrong on the prognosis and today I am NED after two brain surgeries, whole brain radiation and radiation on my hip, as well as a targeted medication for my specific mutation (ALK+ mNSCLC).Yep. Diagnosed mNSCLC in June, 2023. The tumors in my lung had metastasized to the bone (hip and spine) and brain. The biggest tumor in my lung was close to cutting off my lung from my ability to use it and as a result I had severe pneumonia too, with my lung nearly 50% full of fluid. I had to do emergency brain surgery and then shortly after do another brain surgery to install a shunt. A few weeks after I had healed from that I got whole brain radiation and radiation on my hip bone. Then they discovered a mutation in my cancer (ALK+) that allowed me to be put on a drug called Alecensa. June this year I was declared NED. My prognosis changed so much. They thought I wouldn’t make it two days at first and called in my family to get on flights immediately. Then they said 6 weeks - it changed over and over again. Here I am a year later with no evidence of disease.I’m not trying to hijack this post but I just wanted to say thank you for your comment, Popsicles. I’m two months out from being declared NED and my family acts like I should pretty much get over having fought cancer for a year because I’m NED.

              " \"I was diagnosed with kidney cancer at 43. they removed my kidney and I was fine until this year when they found it had spread to my liver and lymph nodes. in the years leading up to this year, my wife struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations. I didn't take care of myself last year like I should have and sometimes I really feel like if I had, I might not have been in this situation. I'm in a clinical trial at penn testing a new drug along with opdivo immunotherapy (after 6 months of treatments my tumors have shrunk by 50%). the best advice I can give is take care of yourself and give yourself grace when you feel down. cry when you need to, but don't overdo it....after a certain point the crying isn't helpful and just starts building your cortisol levels, which lead to stress. eat healthy, see a psychologist /therapist if you're not already, cut shitty people out of your life. if the doctors aren't doing what you think is best, get yourself to a place where they are. I am fortunate to live in Delaware, and I'm close to Philly, so I was able to get a 2nd opinion at the university of Pennsylvania. not all doctors and hospitals are created equal. if those chicks make you happy, keep them! if you are worried about what might happen if you're not here, talk to a local animal shelter and see if they can help in the event the worst happens.I'm 46 and male. I have Stage 4 Renal cell papillary cancer that metastized to my liver and lymph nodes. in 2021 I was stage 3a when they removed my right kidney and adrenal gland. I was having CT scans every 6 months, then 9 months and things were good. last year I lost about 30 lbs (I was dieting and the doctors said it seemed fine, but on valentine's day of this year I got the dreaded news. 6 cm tumor on my liver and multiple lesions on my lymph nodes. I got into a clinical trial at penn for a new drug that targets papillary cancer (Zanzalintinib) I take that pill every morning and get an opdivo injection every month. I've been doing this since March and have had 2 scans so far. the tumors have all shrunk by about 50%. I have another scan this Friday. I'm optimistic (for once!) because my side effects for the last 2 months have been bad (thinning hair, skin is breaking out, and diarrhea. even though I'm optimistic, I'm scared to death.

And if they do, there is a good chance that they can be treated with specific medications. I think it took about a month for my bio markers to come back. It was a long wait.I am sorry about your teenage lung cancer. That should never happen. It’s just not fair. I was 38 when I was diagnosed, which is still young for lung cancer but not pediatric. Ask your oncologist to talk to a social worker. They can get you in touch with support groups. I found a lot of comfort in this group. There are a few other women I have met via TikTok who are also in their 30s with lung cancerI ate pretzels and watermelon the week after chemo. It causes a really bad taste in my mouth. So I didn’t have much of an appetiteI was 39 when I did my chemo for lung cancer. It wiped me out days 3-6 I would take multiple naps a day. I would purchase a urinal from Amazon incase the fatigue from chemo makes it hard for your dad to get to the bathroom. Also, have his doctors prescribed a Walker? Or maybe useful if you have to take him back to the office the first week post chemo. Has he tried sleeping with a wedge pillow? Google pills for acid reflex. That might help keep him upright but let him stretch out in bed. I am glad he is drinking water now. Chemo can change your taste buds for a week or two. So water may taste bad. Buy some flavored water packets. Don’t stock up on anything pre chemo. I also lived alone and I bought what I thought I would want to eat if I had the stomach but. But my taste was so off, I didn’t want any of it. Made me hate the taste of the yellow gatoraid. Which was my favorite. I was able to drink the blue flavor, which I normally don’t like. If he is already really bad at eating, you might want to look into continuous glucose monitor. See if he would wear it. That way you can see if his sugar is going too low from not eatingAsk about pain medication for home use after the surgery. My surgeon refused to treat pain with opioids. After two to three weeks of unbearable pain, my friend suggested I reach out to my oncologist. She had no issue treating my pain. Use the incentive spirometer. And walk. Sleeping can be uncomfortable. Make sure you have a few comfy pillows in different sizes to help find a position of comfortI was 38 when I was diagnosed, non smoker. I wish I could blame it on stress. But we don’t know why it’s more commonI had a lobectomy for my lung cancer. I was never offered radiation. I am glad the tumor was removed. I also had like 20 lymph nodes removed and biopsied.The chemo days will have you at the infusion center almost all day. Be prepared to hurry up and wait. Usually the access the port and draw labs. Wait for the lab results. Then wait for in the drugs to be prepared. My oncologist would hydrate me with a bag of IV fluids and nausea medication before the chemo started. My first round was probably the easiest with the fatigue. But the hardest for nausea. It hit about day 3 or 4. I only ate watermelon and pretzels. After the first round we found out what nausea meds worked. By day seven I felt better.',\n",

Had it retested last summer and it hasn’t decreased, but I do have high frequency hearing loss. The audiologist said I shouldn’t be noticing it much, but I really am! These comments are so validating. I struggle BIG time with hearing when there’s background noise. I also DREAD talking on the phone. Apparently there are certain letter sounds that are harder to hear when you have loss at certain frequencies. I teach so work with little kids and was told they can be especially hard to understand . The most recent audiologist suggested looking at audio processing issues (which I’m sure I have, just not sure if it’s related to chemo).

She had been very fit and healthy right up until 3 months before diagnosis and she kept getting the brush off from her doctors - they told her it was a chest infection, sinus infection, arthritis potentially. Eventually a rheumatologist sent her for scans and that’s when it was caught. I’m so sorry you are all going through this. I wish your mum a peaceful passing.I’m so sorry to hear this. My mum had what she and her doctors seemed to think were recurrent sinus and chest infections. She was on antibiotics on and off for 4 months.

She was sent for a brain scan too as she was having excruciating headaches but we never got the results of that because unfortunately she passed away from (mainly) pneumonia just 4 weeks after that original scan. Immunotherapy was what the oncologists were talking about as her best chance though and it gave one of my friends and extra 15 months after she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer with brain and bone mets.

My friends found out eventually. Work never did. I was a full time STEM pre-med in college, starting a new full time job, and trying to deal with chemo all at once. It left me with near nil hours to sleep. I always prioritized school and work, and never finished a full course of chemo. I always gave up. I was very much a type-A gunner in school.

I loved who I was, and I loved my life, because I started off in a completely different place and built it all from there. Cancer broke that lol. To this day, I haven’t come to terms with the fact that my brain is still writing checks that my body can’t cash. Chemo made me stupid. I am extraordinary no longer. I am no longer the best. I am no longer good at almost anything at the first try. I’ve lost my confidence to be honest. I now believe, there is quite a lot that I cannot do, not at least in the way I could before, and that brings a sense of melancholy. Before, failure was never failure. It was…exploration. It was that something required tweaking. Now failure sometimes hurts my ego and everything makes me self conscious about it being cancer related. It’s like I’ve aged backwards in maturity lol Things worked out okay in the end. I was “successful” still, in society’s terms. I retired early. But I do miss who I used to be. I think I would consider myself successful if I can build myself to the person I’d like to be. I think it’s unrealistic now to be extraordinary. I can’t bring my brain back. But I need to adjust now, to a more realistic new norm. And if I can achieve whatever I set, I think they’ll be contentment there. Externally, it’s all doable. In general, people don’t care in the dating life about the cancer in my experience. At work I always hid it, I had to adjust because it was competitive environment. But internally, a level of self awareness and acceptance is required. I was in denial, constantly waiting for things to pass and to get my brain and body back.

I just take it one day at a time!I think this is an individual issue-when you have survived five cancers and been in the “fight “ for 13 years like I have been it truly is a battle. I can’t even count anymore how many tests, appointments, blood draws, hospitalizations, that I have been through. When you start at a lesser stage and end up in the club nobody wants to be in-it triggers all kinds of feelings. I find that people don’t know what to say-if they say things like you mentioned I don’t take it to heart! It’s like when someone says “How are you”?in general (without cancer) I think do they really care how I am or are they just being polite? I don’t think people are trying to be disrespectful. It is a fight-it’s a fight for you life. It never ends when you have cancer! I don’t like the saying either about losing the fight-but that’s what’s ingrained in people!

My Oncologist stated that I have up to seven years to live. I laugh at that. How do they know?? They are not God. If they found a cure for cancer or offered cure for cancer they would go out business. I swear that Pharma is like a mafia. May God bless you and guide you in your decisions . Sending love and light to you.🙏🏻♥️🙏🏻You can have radiation again to your spine. May want to find another oncologist, who will take your needs seriously. Good luck and I’m sorry you’re in so much pain. You really shouldn’t be with all the treatments they have for your bone Metastasis. You have to be your own vocal health Advocate with a strong voice to get your pain under control. 🙏🏻',\n",

It was really frustrating that no one would give me the information on what to expect. There was just the shock when things started to happen. When things changed, they changed really quickly. The nurses explained the mottling of the skin, usually in the extremities (grey and spotty with some pooling of blood where there has been pressure, so underside of legs, back, etc). Extremities go cold when they are close to passing. Make sure they bring mouth spray, mouth sponge swabs, and lip balm as when they stop drinking, you need to keep their lips tongue and top of mouth moist. And also moist wipes to keep their eyes clean. My dad had burst where he would sit up screaming and then go back to sleep. He had a lot of trauma in his life, so his last days were terrifying for him and us. Towards the end, he forgot all our names, and we were all called Miss, but occasionally, he would recognise us and smile or give us kisses. He started choking on solid foods in the last week, so he moved to puree and thickened liquid, he stopped eating first a couple of days after starting puree and then eventually drinking, he did like icy poles which is how we were able to get some fluids into him in the last couple of days. His breathing got really shallow and laboured, and they had to give him a medication to help with the sputum in the back of his throat as he did choke at one point. He would also stop breathing for long periods of time (like sleep apnoea) 30 seconds at a time. His breathing just got shorter and shorter, but it wasn't laboured anymore. It was just little breaths that got smaller and smaller until he passed. We played his favourite music, held his hands, talked to him, re lived happy moments, and had jokes and laughs with him right up till the end.\",\n",

              " 'Yes I did it. Dealing with stage 4 Endometrial cancer , a rare aggressive kind. I did many lines of treatment since May of 2023 and none of them got rid of it. It started spreading again despite other medications etc. In June , the oncologist told me that he wanted to start taxol again . That was my option. I told him nope. It was horrendous before and I was not doing it again if it wasn\\'t even going to cure it. Once you quit treatment , your doctor recommends you for hospice. I believe you need a prognosis of six months or less for hospice. I love my hospice nurse. She comes once a week right now , unless I can convince her to do a telehealth visit. She makes medication suggestions and everything is at the doorstep next day.Right now I\\'m still active and busy. I\\'m dealing with overall body aches and pains like when you have the flu, and liver pain. But I take pain meds that are available to me and I do normal as much as possible. I go out often, drive places , cook, etc. Once you are on hospice, they will stop treatment for everything. So just be aware of that. For instance, they suspected that I had a blood clot in my leg. I was told since I\\'m in hospice it was not going to be treated, however if I wanted it to be treated I could take myself off of hospice, have whatever procedure done, and then sign myself right on again the next day. So it\\'s not like once you\\'re on hospice you\\'re stuck there. You can take yourself off if you decide to have a treatment etc. I hope this helps. For me, it was an easy choice because chemo was such hell, and I wasn\\'t about to do that again if it wasn\\'t going to result in at least a remission etc.Also , I would strongly suggest an antidepressant. The kind of crap we\\'ve dealt with would leave anyone with a scrambled brain. I was crying constantly. I told my oncologist flat out I was not okay. She recommended me to the hospital\\'s cancer psychiatrist who put me on a low dose of antidepressant. It\\'s honestly been extremely game changing for me. The hospice nurse can also can give medications for anxiety etc. I\\'m so sorry you\\'re dealing with all this crap.Wow, you are a rock star! That\\'s amazing!Also understand that you can pick and choose what to do with hospice. I find my hospice nurse to be amazingly chill and flexible. I decided to stop the social worker services. I wasn\\'t crazy about her constant talk about needing to know all my funeral arrangements etc. and how do I feel about becoming incapacitated etc ( I think it\\'s great, how would you feel??) I am still living here and now and very active and want to focus on that for now. So no more social worker. No chaplain because I have a wonderful pastor and his wife who look after me by calling every couple of days to pray with me and talk etc. My adult kids who live at home are in counseling and my husband starts counseling this week. So adding a social worker to the mix is just more time away from doing all i want to do and they are a-okay with all that.I find hospice to be very flexible and reassuring. I sought their help long before I really needed it and it absolutely put my mind at ease. It took me a week to build up the courage to call once the doctor put in the recommendation, but im glad I did.No it\\'s normal. I am battling endometrial cancer at 55. I have permanent sags under my eyes from crying this past year. Let me tell you, you need to get help. I finally bottomed out and said I need help. They set me up at the hospital psychiatrist who put me on an antidepressant. It helped immediately. I\\'m also on Ativan as needed. They honestly do not understand the psychological and emotional impact of cancer. I\\'m hoping that once you get the surgery you start to feel better. A lot of this is dread and fear. All of your emotions are normal and you\\'re not going crazy. Cancer is a rape and a thief ; it steals from you, it violates your body it invades your life and your plans. Everything that you\\'re going through is normal however that doesn\\'t mean that you have to endure it. There are medications that can help you. I\\'ve never been on an antidepressant in my life and never thought I needed it. However within a week of starting to take the anti depressant I began to be able to think clearer. Horrible anxiety went away. Hang in there and check back in because there were many people here who know exactly how you feel.Totally get it , I have a very rare and aggressive endometrial and yet another friend today is trying to send me another alternative remedy. I told her please don\\'t. I\\'ve tried them ALL and nothing worked and all the regular medical stuff didn\\'t either. People think cancer is cancer. Chris beat cancer so that means you can too. Never mind that every cancer and every body is different! Ugh it\\'s frustrating. I finally just said \"look, it\\'s me and God now and I\\'m at peace with whatever happens. If I get an unexplained miracle, I\\'m at peace. If I go home, I\\'m at peace. But I\\'m not chasing down the next snake oil or rabbit hole\". People don\\'t understand that not all cancer is the same. Treatment for endometrial is vastly underfunded because it\\'s so rare. Treatment for metastatic breast cancer HAS come a long way because it\\'s so common and so well funded. People don\\'t get it. They aren\\'t all the sameI had a friend on another group in 2010 who was given 36 months with metastatic breast cancer in several places. She had two babies. She ended up living about ten more years. Hand in there mama, a moms desire to live is the greatest of all because of her children. Praying a great treatment for you to knock this down and out for many good years with your family!I stopped chemo. It wasn\\'t working and the option I had to knock it back was hard chemo again. I said no way. If it was just gonna give me extra months forget that crap. I thought I\\'d die on taxol the first time around. No way. Now I\\'m active and living well but on hospice. The tumors hurt and have grown a lot. But I\\'m still here. This is a decision that you have to make, nobody else. Just like mine was. I remember talking to my mom about it, and she said nobody can make that decision except you. I was honestly sick and tired of being a patient, sick and tired of being with the cancer center constantly, sick and tired of low blood counts pain and all the other things that come along with cancer treatment. I did it for a year and a half and basically had nothing to show for it at the end of that. So my situation is a little different than yours. It sounds like your chemo has somewhat kept it at bay so you have to make the choice to keep going with it and can you live with the side effects, or to just say no more. There\\'s no one that can tell you what is right or wrong except for you. Nobody who hasn\\'t gone through this can possibly understand what it\\'s like. I\\'m really tough and I can power through a lot if it\\'s got a good end result, but for me it was just going to prolong things. I think if I was given the option of a treatment that would possibly eradicate it and put me into remission , I would do that. This is a discussion you need to have with your oncologist as well. My oncologist was really great. He told me he wanted to put me back on taxol since then the other chemos were working, and I told him no. He said,\"talk to me\". I appreciate it that he was so open to listening. I told him that there was no way I was doing taxol again. It was crappy in 2010 when I did it for breast cancer but it was far more crappy and I thought I would die when I did it last year for endometrial cancer and I\\'m not doing it again. He listened to me and didn\\'t try to change my decision and was completely respectful of that. He did make sure that I knew that no treatment meant that the disease would progress. I told him I wasn\\'t afraid.Pathology shouldn\\'t show the stage, stage is determined by the location of the tumor(s) and size. If cancer spreads from its original place to an organ or bones that is called stage 4. That being said people can live with stage 4 cancer for many years depending on treatment , etc. I\\'m sorry , nothing sucks more than bad cancer news. Push your doctor for next steps! If it\\'s just in one location often they can surgically remove it or radiate it.I\\'m surprised with stage 2 that you didn\\'t need chemo. I had chemo at stage 2a. I guess it depends on the grade. Anyway chemo for breast cancer is def doable. Keep on your anti nausea meds. Do you know who Lorna Luft is? Judy Garlands daughter. She\\'s a singer in her 70s now. Well she had breast cancer and it came back in her ribs and a spot on her brain. She had surgery for both and treatment and they removed some of her ribs etc. My point is that she\\'s back to doing concerts the past few years since that happened! And living a very full life. Often breast cancer can be lived with for a long long time. Take one day at a time. Don\\'t fear chemo. Take one chemo at a time. Just keep focused on the day in front of you.I had palliative radiation to my hip even though I already had pelvic radiation. A good radiation oncologist will assess how much radiation you\\'ve had to an area and see if they can give you a couple doses more. I\\'m so sorry you\\'re dealing with this. Bone mets suck. Mine absolutely throbbed. The radiation did help.Honestly you can\\'t. You just need to keep telling them every cancer is different and your care team knows what kind yours is, etc. It is maddening I know. I recently stopped treatment because nothing is working and I have a friend who insisted that there was a kind of chemo that has zero side effects and it kills everything cancer. It\\'s like yeah I think that if that was available to me it would be available to me. Kept insisting that I asked my doctor so I finally did just to shut her up and no it\\'s not an option and yes it has a ton of side effects. People see or hear one thing online or they see some kind of TV commercial or something and they think they have the answer. It really makes everything about cancer even harder when you have people coming at you from all sides with all sorts of \" cures\" some of the medical and some of them are not. There was a woman at church who constantly approaches me and I finally just keep telling her no. No, no more. I think she finally got the clue this last time. The hard thing is that these people mean well and they want to see you well. But they have no idea that it\\'s very taxing to hear this kind of thing coming at you from all directions.Delta 8 gummies helped me with nausea and allergies but I\\'m ultra sensitive and I didn\\'t like how they made me feel. I couldn\\'t even tolerate a half in without being buzzy. Can she layer compazine and zofran together?I wouldn\\'t have read the results. I never looked at my reports until I was sitting with the doctor. But since you already did, just know that I had a solid lymph node at my collar bone after having a mastectomy. I totally lost my mind. They scanned it and it was a solid mass. They surgically removed it and biopsied it and it was nothing, just what they called a benign \"reactive node\". Idk why it was solid but it was nothing at all. That was in 2011. Also immunotherapy can cause massive lung nodules. I imagine other drugs can too. I know someone whose lungs were full of them after keytruda and now they are all gone. So don\\'t panic now. Do you have Xanax or Ativan you can take for this weekend?',\n",

Mine is a double blind study, where I dont know if I'm getting the placebo or the real drug. I opted to do it, despite the possible side effects, because it can come back and because it means they'll be keeping a much closer eye on me than if I wasnt in trial. I get a CT more frequently, PET scans more frequently, and meet with oncologist more frequently. Because of this more frequent testing, we caught 2 large colon polyps right before they became cancerous (they lit up on PET scan, but were declared precancerous when removed and tested). So, that keeping a closer eye on things has already paid off (I'm a little over a year into the trial). Is the flying to Houston every 4 weeks for my clinical trial a bit of a pain? Yes.

I have survivors guilt, chemo brain and a few other long term side effects and I have very bad days sometimes. Cancer affects you for the rest of your life and anybody who has never had it will never truly understand our pain and trauma. I believe chemo itself and the after effects are both the absolute worst. I also stopped believing in god the day I was diagnosed. I will not worship a god that gives kids cancer. Don\\'t listen to anybody who has never gone through it, I love my dad but I know for a fact that god was not with me during that hell.Want a macaroon?I had anxiety before cancer so I have some experience of managing it in my daily life (including medication, narrative therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy). I have terrible \"scanxiety\" when going for scans and tests .I agree, my dad truly believes that since I\\'ve been in remission for so long now that it\\'s never going to come back and I just look at him and say nothing.

I was 15 when I was diagnosed (same cancer), 16 when I finished treatment, and I didn’t feel “normal-ish” until about 19.

It gets better, I promise you!Also a Hodgkins Lymphoma survivor here (she 15 at diagnosis) and I feel weird about being a survivor, I feel like for a LONG time during and after chemo it defined who I was. The very definition of my existing was either cancer patient or cancer survivor. I’m about to be 32 and I’ve spent more years of my living life as a survivor than the 15 years before the cancer… and it kind of makes me mad. I don’t talk about it much anymore because there’s not much of a need to and I want my life to be defined by who I am in my soul, not on a cellular level. Hey y’all, none of us are alone! Cancer puts us in weird mental places, and that ok! \\U0001faf6I was diagnosed at 17. Next month marks 40 years for me. I too figured I wouldn\\'t last long. They told me I might get 15-20 years. Here\\'s some advice: Don\\'t measure yourself by others. You have experienced a trauma that they haven\\'t. You\\'re also experiencing an ongoing trauma that is especially impacting given your age. More and more is being learned about the physical and mental late term effects. Depending on your location, there are resources to help, especially if you\\'re a childhood survivor. Many \"Children\\'s\" hospitals have programs specifically for survivors of all ages. I\\'m fortunate to have access to one. Many of the teaching hospitals also have programs. I struggle with after effects also. My psychiatrist daignosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder due to the trauma. (A good psychiatrist can help.) I\\'ve also been told I\\'ll need a new heart valve soon on top of the four stents I have. And occasionally I feel like I\\'ve wasted too much time trying to be \"normal.\\' I\\'ve had a succesful career, but I can\\'t have children and didn\\'t want to adopt because the idea of possibly dying with a young child didn\\'t appeal to me. But I digress. If you\\'d like, you can send me a message and I\\'ll be happy to find the resources you need. Actually that goes for anyone on this sub. If you need an advocate to help you find what you need, PM me.Survivors guilt can be horrible. I didn’t think about it too much growing up but sometimes I can’t get it out of my head. Sometimes I get depressed and wonder if the world would be significantly different if I never made it. I’d love to talk with people that understand this better. That’s one of the reasons why I’m glad I found this sub.Your feelings are valid. Well said.You’re not alone in feeling like this! I’m about to turn a weird corner for myself and it’s a happy-sad feeling: I was 15 when I was diagnosed, and I’m about to round 16 years remission which means I’ll have spent more of my life as a cancer survivor than I ever spent as a normal kid. It’s like when women get married and someday have had their married last name longer than their maiden last name? I think it becomes more difficult to remember what life was like NOT as a survivor with every passing year. And it’s a weird ass feeling… grateful to be here, dealing with long term effects, frustrated with knowing I’ve been held back in certain aspects yet overwhelmed with pride at how far I’ve come at the same time. Bag of mixed nuts!! Salty nuts at that… You’re not alone!I’m sorry for your loss but I’m glad that you’re doing okay. My situation was weird. Nobody else in my family ever had cancer.

I had chemo and radiation back in the 80s. If you\\'ve had mantle radation you need a good cardiologist, and if you\\'ve had any radiotherapy at all, you need to watch your thyroid.

Felt invincible. Was diagnosed in March and felt like my whole world stopped. Went through treatment with the mindset of just doing what I needed to day by day to give myself the best chance of beating it. Became increasingly depressed and completely numb to the world during. I couldn’t work, travel, see friends, I lost my partner, my body changed, I lost my hair, felt too weak to do much at all. Thankfully I got NED in June. Had final surgery around then as well and am in monitoring now. Im absolutely infinitely grateful to be in this spot, but honestly - I don’t think I’ll be back to the person I was, the utter trauma this experience has caused has genuinely fucked me up and is indescribable to anyone who hasn’t been through it. I still read my bloodwork notes and stand there in disbelief that the damn thing says ‘malignant tumor’. I was seeing a therapist for a while, but i felt like it wasn’t helping. For now, im just focusing on the good things in life, and trying not to dwell on the future too much - it’s easy to worry sick about recurrence. I’ve built back enough strength to get out and do things, I’ve found more value in working out than I ever have before - it’s been so helpful mentally. Back into a work routine, but completely out of dating for now as I’ve taken a huge step backward in being comfortable in myself which sucks. But all in all, just continuing to take it day by day because nothing is guaranteed in life. Survivorship is definitely tougher than I expected.',\n",

Its still hard sometimes because the relationship feels unbalanced because he has much more energy than me. But he is okay with that. He takes care for me and before my chemo he told me he really wanted to fight this battle together as a team.

Maybe because my self esteem is crap after all treatments because my body looks like a 50 year old, but maybe because guys just don’t want to date a woman with cancer. I don’t know.

Now before I went into kidney failure, I had been talking with my now fiancee about whether or not she still wanted me to propose with the possibility of a cancer diagnosis. If she wanted out instead of possibly watching me die. I went into the hospital with kidney failure 3 days after I proposed. I thought for sure I was going to die in that hospital.

In the end, while the lung cancer stabilized, the brain mets kept growing and caused progressive loss of control in one side of his body.

It was a huge shock as she’s a non-smoker and has always been quite healthy. I’d strongly recommend a biopsy with genetic testing if that’s not already been requested. Some lung cancers occur due to a genetic mutation (like EGFR) and there’s targeted treatment available (Tagrisso for EGFR) that’s highly effective for most patients with such mutation. Stage 4 cancer is a lot to deal with, but I can say our family is in a much better place now than at the start, when there was so much uncertainty, fear, and not knowing how to navigate through it all. You will work it out together. Sending you strength.Really sorry to hear about your mum. I have a similar story. My mum went to see the doctor about back pain a couple of months ago and was diagnosed with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer that’s metastasised to the spine. The biopsy results will be very important because if she has certain gene mutations she can have targeted treatment (like Tagrisso for EGFR mutation) that can be effective for a while with few side effects. There are people who have taken Tagrisso for years on Reddit and other forums. So make sure they do genetic testing as part of the biopsy. I’d advise against reading the survival stats online. The data is mostly very old, before the availability of targeted treatment. The data also doesn’t separate by age, so you have 80/90 year olds who were near the end alongside much younger people. Sending you strength ❤️Wonderful news, thank you for sharing the positivity, and wishing you continued progress.Thank you, I really appreciate this. What was the trajectory like in the days after starting radio, e.g. did you feel worse before feeling better? She has bone destruction at c5 and L5. I just want her to feel a bit better so she can see there is hope.Thank you for your story, that gives me a lot of hope.She’s in NI and it’s public holidays until Tuesday frustratingly. She was told maybe she’ll see the oncologist a week later, but it’s very vague. I’m very frustrated by the whole process (NHS) but appreciate it can be a whole lot worse.Thank you, I’m glad you’re feeling better. They’re doing the gene mutation testing and I’m hopeful for EGFR as she’s an east Asian non-smoker. I just need to get that oncologist appt asap.Thanks for your reply. I’m in EGFR resisters and it’s very informative. This is for when we have the exact mutation information - but is there a resource on prognosis by mutation? For example, the prognosis for those with mutations that can be targeted must be better than for those without.Thank you for this. Did they say prognosis for Tagrisso is 5 years?UPDATE: My mum saw her oncologist today who said she has EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation, plus a rare ILE706THR mutation. She’s starting Tagrisso next week assuming her blood tests are normal. The doctor said Tagrisso works on average for 2 years but varies. In the circumstances, I think this is positive. I hope everyone else is doing ok.Thank you, same to you ❤️Thanks so much for this. What did the doctor say to you about the prognosis, if you don’t mind me asking? My mum is such a trooper too.

I struggled with the notion of “fighting” at first. I thought about the people who are so sick at the time of their diagnosis that they don’t even get the chance to “fight” and we would never say that they didn’t “fight” or “gave up” or whatever, so I keep thinking to myself how on earth can we call it a fight when it seems like luck/random for those who even get an opportunity to see treatment and have a chance to survive…I almost felt like calling it “fighting” was a slap in the face to those who don’t have a chance to “fight”… Then I came to my own conclusion that fighting is just continuing on with cancer. Whether it’s showing up to work every day, or laying in a hospital bed. Whether you feel great or you’re encumbered by intense pain.

Firstly, I was told that I’m early in treatment so we aren’t even necessarily expecting shrinkage because the immunotherapy may not have had enough time to begin working yet. So I am very happy to see a response already, I am hoping that this is a good sign for long term results. Second, through my lung cancer journey I have been reading about how new genetic mutations and targeted therapy are “changing the game” for lung cancer treatment and how it’s saving lives. However, I have found way less hopeful insight around treatment for patients that do not have these targetable mutations, and I do not have any of these mutations so I was worried that treatment would be less effective for me. I almost felt left out and like I had less hope. I am hoping that I will have some continued success with treatment and can provide hope for patients who don’t have targeted therapy and have to stick with the standard chemo/immunotherapy. Overall, we are not out of the woods yet, but for how early I am in treatment I think this is a very good response and we wouldn’t be expecting much more this early on based on what I discussed with my care team.',\n",

She went full keto and carnivor, continued to practice Brazilian jiu jitsu the whole time, did do some chemo and radiotherapy but didn’t find anything convincing and it was later confirmed by her doctors that they can be good short term but that they basically create an environment for the cancer to grow back in the long term.

The anniversary of the day I was diagnosed I make sure to make a mental note of how far I’ve come since that day. The day i had a cancer free scan? Couldn’t tell you.

Im very worried at this point, i dont know what lies ahead, or what my probabilities are. They found the tumor looking for the cause of increasing painfull sciatica.

I loved all the attention I had gotten during treatment that I feel like I lost a lot of who I was to become the \"cancer kid\". It took a lot of self reflection and a lot of getting over myself. For a long time after that I wouldn\\'t talk about my experience unless someone else brought it up. But almost 20 years later and now I just talk about it casually if it comes up in conversation. I don\\'t bring up any of the darker stuff unless people specifically ask. Ultimately you are a \"survivor\", but what that means is up to you, but I promise it gets much less awkward talking about and much easier to joke about. Hope I could help a bit, good luck.',\n",
